## [A. Divisibility Problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/A)
Simple question. Answer is (b - (a % b)) % b.

## [B. K-th Beautiful String](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/B)
For finding the pattern, the list can be divided into blocks. In each block the value of the first b is fixed.
```
-----
i = 1
aaabb
-----
i = 2
aabab
aabba
-----
i = 3
abaab
ababa
abbaa
-----
i = 4
baaab
baaba
babaa
bbaaa
-----
```
```
So, consider the position of first b corresponding to i.
i = 1, b is at n - 1
i = 2, b is at n - 2
...
i = i, b is at n - i

So, first we need to find this value of i, the iteration to which k belongs to. For example, if i = 4 for values of k from 7 to 10, for n = 5.

remaining values = k - i * (i + 1) / 2, because at each i, there are i * (i + 1) / 2 combinations
Second b's position = n - remaining + 1
```
In the implementation, the value of i is found with binary search which points to the block just before the block which contains k.
```cpp
int binary_search(int n, int k) {
    int lo = 0, hi = n;
    int ans = 0;
    while(lo <= hi) {
        ll mid = (lo + hi) >> 1LL;
        ll x = (mid * (mid + 1LL)) >> 1LL;
        if(x < k) {
            ans = mid;
            lo = mid + 1;
        } else {
            hi = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int t; cin >> t;
while(t--) {
    int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
    int iteration = binary_search(n, k);
    int first_b_pos = n - iteration - 1;
    int remaining = k - (iteration * (iteration + 1LL)) / 2LL;
    int second_b_pos = n - remaining + 1;

    string ans(n, 'a');
    ans[first_b_pos - 1] = 'b';
    ans[second_b_pos - 1] = 'b';
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```
