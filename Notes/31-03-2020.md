## [C. Ternary XOR](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/C)
Simple question. 
```
For 0 -> always use 0, 0
For 1 -> always use 0 and 1, assign the 0 to the larger among a and b
For 2 -> use 1 and 1 till both a and b are equal, after that use 2 and 0, 2 to the larger
```
Here's the code -
```cpp
int n; cin >> n;
string x; cin >> x;
string a(n, '1'), b(n, '1');
bool became_unequal = false; // a > b after this
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if(x[i] == '0') {
        a[i] = b[i] = '0';
    } else if(x[i] == '1') {
        if(!became_unequal) {
            a[i] = '1';
            b[i] = '0';
            became_unequal = true;
        } else {
            a[i] = '0';
            b[i] = '1';
        }
    } else if(x[i] == '2') {
        if(!became_unequal) {
            a[i] = '1';
            b[i] = '1';
        } else {
            a[i] = '0';
            b[i] = '2';
        }
    }
}
cout << a << endl << b << endl;

## [A. Exercising Walk](https://codeforces.com/contest/1332/problem/A)
Logic is to not move farther oscillate around a point as much as possible. So, if left = 4 and right = 6, oscillate for the first 8 steps and then move 2 steps right. The edge case is if left = right, then even though the final position is (x, y), the intermediate positions can be either (x - 1, y) or (x + 1, y) depending on which direction we took the first step for oscillation. So, in this case, try to take the first step in the direction where there is some room.
```cpp
int a, b, c, d; cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
int x, y, x1, y1, x2, y2; cin >> x >> y >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
int del_x = b - a;
int del_y = d - c;
int best_x = x + del_x;
int best_y = y + del_y;
if(del_x == 0) {
    if(a != 0) { // b != 0 also, as a = b
        if(x1 < x) { // there's room to move left
            --best_x;
        } else if(x2 > x) { // there's room to move right
            ++best_x; 
        } else {
            // there's no room, answer's gonna be NO in any case ++ or --
            ++best_x;
        }
    }
} 
if(del_y == 0) {
    if(c != 0) {
        if(y1 < y) {
            --best_y;
        } else if(y2 > y) {
            ++best_y;
        } else {
            ++best_y;
        }
    }
}
if(best_x >= x1 and best_x <= x2 and best_y >= y1 and best_y <= y2) {
    cout << "YES" << endl; 
} else {
    cout << "NO" << endl;
}
