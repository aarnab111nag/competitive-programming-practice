The answer to this problem is at most 3. Let's prove it by construction.

Firstly, if all ti are equal then the answer is 1. Otherwise, there are at least two different values in the array t so the answer is at least 2. If n is even then the answer is always 2 because you can color figures in the following way: [1,2,1,2,…,1,2]. If n is odd then consider two cases. The first case is when some pair of adjacent figures have the same type. Then the answer is 2 because you can merge these two values into one and get the case of even n. Otherwise, all pairs of adjacent figures have different types and if you consider this cyclic array as a graph (cycle of length n) then you can notice that it isn't bipartite so you need at least 3 colors to achieve the answer (color all vertices in such a way that any two adjacent vertices have different colors). And the answer looks like [1,2,1,2,…,1,2,3].
```cpp
int n; cin >> n;
vi a(n);
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
}
vi color(n);
int ans;
if(count(ALL(a), a[0]) == n) {
    ans = 1;
    color.assign(n, 1);
} else if(n % 2 == 0) {
    ans = 2;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        color[i] = (i % 2) + 1;
    }
} else {
    ans = 3;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        color[i] = (i % 2) + 1;
        if(a[i] == a[(i + 1) % n]) {
            ans = 2;
            // merge these two to the same color, to make it similar to the even case
            color[(i + 1) % n] = color[i]; 
            for(int j = i + 2; j < n; ++j) {
                color[j] = ((j - 1) % 2) + 1;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    if(ans == 3) {
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            color[i] = (i % 2) + 1;
        } 
        color[n - 1] = 3;
    }
} 
cout << ans << endl;
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << color[i] << " ";
}
cout << endl;
