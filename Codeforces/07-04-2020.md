## [D. Walk on Matrix](https://codeforces.com/contest/1332/problem/D)
The given algorithm doesn't work as max function doesn't provide the optimal answer (4 & 3 < 3 & 3).
Study the second test case to get the logic. Consider the example - 
```
k = 9 -> 1001
[11111 1111     0]
[10000 11111 1001]
```
The algorithm uses: 11111 -> 10000 -> 11111 -> 1001, answer = 0 <br>
Optimal answer: 11111 -> 1111 -> 11111 -> 1001, answer = k
```cpp
int k; cin >> k;
int d = (int)log2(k) + 1;
vvi ans =   {   
                {(1 << (d + 1)) - 1,        (1 << d) - 1,           0}, 
                {1 << d,                    (1 << (d + 1)) - 1,     k}  
            };
cout << "2 3" << endl;
cout << ans[0][0] << " " << ans[0][1] << " " << ans[0][2] << endl;
cout << ans[1][0] << " " << ans[1][1] << " " << ans[1][2] << endl;
```
