## [D2. Prefix-Suffix Palindrome (Hard version)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1326/problem/D2)
The idea was to match characters from both ends till they match and then find the longest palindromic prefix and suffix and see which forms the longest palindrome when attached to the macthed characters.
In this hard version prefix function is used to obtain the longest plaindromic prefix and suffix. 

The prefix function for a string of length n is defined as an array π of length n, where π[i] is the length of the longest proper prefix of the substring s[0…i] which is also a suffix of this substring. 

So, if reverse(s) = s' and length of s#s' is n1. Then π[n1 - 1] would give the largest prefix which is also a suffix. Since, an # is included, this prefix can't have length longer than n. And since the prefix belongs to s and suffix belongs to s', and prefix = suffix, it is a palindrome.
```cpp
vi prefix_function(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    vi pi(n);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int j = pi[i - 1];
        // invariant: j is the length of the prefix which matches the suffix at i - 1
        while (j > 0 && s[i] != s[j])
            j = pi[j - 1];
        if (s[i] == s[j])
            pi[i] = j + 1; // note that j is 0-indexed, so length is 1 more
        else
            pi[i] = j;
    }
    return pi;
}

int t; cin >> t;
while(t--) {
    string s; cin >> s; wi(s)
    int n = s.length();
    int match_cnt = 0;
    while(match_cnt < (n / 2) and  s[match_cnt] == s[n - match_cnt - 1]) {
        ++match_cnt;
    }
    string unmatched = s.substr(match_cnt, n - 2 * match_cnt);
    string unmatched_reverse = string(unmatched.rbegin(), unmatched.rend());
    string fwd = unmatched + '#' + unmatched_reverse;
    string bwd = unmatched_reverse + '#' + unmatched;
    int lpp = prefix_function(fwd)[fwd.length() - 1]; // longest palindromic prefix
    int lps = prefix_function(bwd)[bwd.length() - 1]; // longest palindromic suffix
    if(lpp >= lps)
        cout << s.substr(0, match_cnt + lpp) << s.substr(n - match_cnt, match_cnt) << endl;
    else
        cout << s.substr(0, match_cnt) << s.substr(n - match_cnt - lps, match_cnt + lps) << endl;
